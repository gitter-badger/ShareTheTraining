## Todo
* non-blocking action
* handler testcases
* Scala is such a beautiful language while our code is a piece of shit. Rock Me Hard Place.
* Use "User user = (User) Context.current().args.get("connected");" to get current user
* Seriously, Java sucks. Writing promise in Java is making me fucking high.
